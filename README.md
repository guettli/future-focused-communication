# future-focused-language

I am struggeling with finding the right words very often.

In the past people felt insulted several times, although this was not my intention

# Which benefits do you see?

Old: Why should I do it?
Future focused: Which benefits do you see?

# How can I help you?

Old: What do you want?
Future focused: How can I help you?

..


# Silence

Old: I don't care
Future focused: Silence. Or swit

I think this a very healty attitude in the 21 century. Daily several hundred things which look important hit your brain. People are dying all over the planet, and you don't care? 

If I can't influence the situation, then I can't help. If I can't help it does not improve the situation if I have no empathy. But empathy is the trend. It is en vogue... blablabla.

I support charitable organizations. That is something I can do and I do it. This makes my world view coherent. This gives me the right to think "I don't care".

Unfortunately this sound aggressive and that's why I never say "I don't care". I say nothing or I choose another topic for conversation.
