## Introduction

> “Watch your thoughts; they become your words…
> Watch your words; they become your actions…
> Watch your actions; they become your habits…
> Watch your habits; they become your character…
> Watch your character, for it will become your destiny.” (Talmud)

I think you can't influence your thoughts. But you can influence your words, your language.


I struggled with finding the right words very often.

In the past people felt insulted several times, although this was not my intention

# ff: Which benefits do you see?

Old: Why should I do it?

Future focused: Which benefits do you see?

# ff: How can I help you?

Old: What do you want?

Future focused: How can I help you?

..


# ff: Silence

Old: I don't care

Future focus: I say nothing, I choose another topic for conversation or say "I don't know".

I think this a very healty attitude in the 21 century. Daily several hundred things which look important hit your brain. People are dying all over the planet, and you don't care? 

If I can't influence the situation, then I can't help. 

If I can't help and I don't know the suffering people, then it does not change the situation if I have empathy or not. But empathy is the trend. It is en vogue... blablabla.


If I can't help and I know the suffering people, then I can help by sharing my time and listening. But then I usualy don't think "I don't care".

I support charitable organizations. That is something I can do and I do it. This makes my world view coherent. This gives me the right to think "I don't care" to all the bad things which happen far away.

Unfortunately this sound aggressive and that's why I never say "I don't care". I say nothing or I choose another topic for conversation.

If you are in an environment where you think "I don't care" and you are not able to choose another topic for conversation very often. Then it is very likely that you in an environment which usaly gets called "school". Grab a pen and paint something. Write down the things the teacher said. Focus on you goal: to graduate from school.


# The opposite: The confusing language

Let's have a look at a different way to communicate: Sentences which express the need for a change without any particular hint how the goal looks like.

Imagine you are a small ant. You have 360° around you. This is one full turn. You want to help someone. But this someone does not tell you the direction. You just get the hint that your current direction is wrong. This is confusing. Now you know that one of 360 options is wrong. Leaving you with 359 options :-(

* I am not amused
* that's not what I had in mind.

Or pseudo wise quotes like:

* Use the right tool for the job (This is even worse. This is like "one plus one is two". It contains no useful content)
* It depends.
